Description: Implements a goodness of fit test of the presumed Gaussian
    distribution of the random effect in generalized linear mixed models. This
    package implements the method described in Tchetgen Tchetgen and Coull 
    (2006) A Diagnostic Test for the Mixing Distribution in a Generalised Linear 
    Mixed Model for logistic models fit with lme4::glmer().
